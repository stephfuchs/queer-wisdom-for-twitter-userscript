The "**Queer wisdom for Twitter**" script adds a button with a queer flag for the LGBTQIA+ community. By clicking the
flag the script the page will reload and display the modal with a random queer wisdom.

If you want to add another quote, just click the flag again, it will randomly generate a new tweet. In some cases you
will receive the same tweet. that is the fun with random, right?
