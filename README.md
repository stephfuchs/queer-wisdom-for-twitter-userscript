# Read me for "Tampermonkey script: Queer wisdom for Twitter"

## Introduction

The "Queer wisdom for Twitter" script adds a button with a queer flag for the LGBTQIA+ community. By clicking the flag
the script will add a random wisdom. There is a list of quotes provided by a JSON file. So the script automatically gets
quote-updates. Updates concerning the script are just as features or bugfixing.
