## Tampermonkey

This project includes a user script for the Chrome Addon [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

If the addon is installed, just click on
"[raw](https://github.com/stephfuchs/tampermonkey-queer-wisdom-for-twitter/raw/master/queer-wisdom-for-twitter.user.js)"
and the extension opens an interface to install the script. Just click "install" to make sure you get the queer stuff.
